# Prefix-to-Infix-conversion-with-proper-paranthesization-

Prefix : An expression is called the prefix expression if the operator appears in the expression before the operands. Simply of the form (operator operand1 operand2).

Infix : The expression of the form a op b. When an operator is in-between every pair of operands.

#Implementation:

I have implemented prefix to infix conversion(with proper paranthesization) using Stack.

#Algorithm:
